This is a RESTful API using NodeJS and ExpressJS using the REST verbs - GET,POST,PUT,DELETE and even PATCH using HATEOAS. Unit and Integration Testing is performed using Sinon and Mocha.

The representations returned for REST resources contain not only data, but links to related resources. Thus the design of the representations is crucial to the design of the overall service
